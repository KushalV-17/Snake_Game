# Snake_Game
In this project I have developed a Snake and Food Game using python 

In this Game a snake will move in the given area and food will randomly pop up in area. A point will be scored when snake eats the food and this will also increase the snake's length.

Game will end if the snake hits the boundary wall of the area or itself by curling around.

Some of the below images  demonstrates the game.
